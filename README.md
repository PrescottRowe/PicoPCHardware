This is a basic computer that uses a pin pad as input and displays to a seven-segment display and grid light array. The computer has various storage types, ALU, and several types of counters, timers, processes along with a total of 21 assembly instruction types. Several of the ISE-vhd files used in the schematics were created by California Optical Engineering, D. Schaafsma. These files have credit references within them. The schematics were created by myself (Prescott Rowe) and P. Jardin. The computer works without know errors and each module has gone through several weeks of everyday testing. The final grade for the project was over 100% as there are extra credit assembly instructions loaded.
