This computer uses a 12 button pin-pad and 8 toggle switches as input and displays to a 4 digit seven-segment display and 5 led light array. The computer has various storage types, ALU, several types of counters, timers, along with a total of 21 assembly instruction types built in(more can be programmed in for a total of 32 when in programming mode). Several of the ISE-vhd files used in the schematics were created by California Optical Engineering, D. Schaafsma. These files have credit references within them. The design of the computer and corresponding schematics were created by myself (Prescott Rowe) and P. Jardin. The computer works without "know" errors and each module has gone through several weeks of everyday testing. The final grade for the project was over 100% as there are extra credit assembly instructions loaded.
